Log4j Runtime Dependencies
Some Log4J features depend on external libraries. This page lists the required and optional dependencies.

As of version 2.10.0 the Log4j API is a Java module (with a module-info.java). Many of the other jars are automatic modules. The characteristics of the modules are:

Artifact Name	Module Name	Module Characteristics
log4j-api	org.apache.logging.log4j	
Module Directive	Notes
exports org.apache.logging.log4j	
exports org.apache.logging.log4j.message	
exports org.apache.logging.log4j.simple	
exports org.apache.logging.log4j.spi	
exports org.apache.logging.log4j.spi	
exports org.apache.logging.log4j.util	Some classes in this package are used by the logging implementation and should be considered private. The module info definition may be modified in the future to export these only to the logging implmentation.
uses org.apache.logging.log4j.spi.Provider	Service that must be provided by the logging implementation.
log4j-appserver	org.apache.logging.log4j.appserver	Automatic Module
log4j-cassandra	org.apache.logging.log4j.cassandra	Automatic Module

log4j-mongodb	org.apache.logging.log4j.mongodb	Automatic Module
log4j-osgi	org.apache.logging.log4j.osgi	Automatic Module. Unclear how OSGi will support Java modules.
log4j-slf4j-impl	org.apache.logging.log4j.slf4j.impl	Automatic Module. May require renaming should SLF4J ever require all implementations to have the same module name.
log4j-taglib	org.apache.logging.log4j.taglib	Automatic Module
log4j-to-slf4j	org.apache.logging.log4j.slf4j	Automatic Module
log4j-web	org.apache.logging.log4j.web	Automatic Module
As of version 2.9.1 Log4j supports Java 9 but will still work in Java 7 or 8. In this version log4j-api is packaged as a multi-release jar and supports the use of the StackWalker and Process APIs.

As of version 2.4, Log4J requires Java 7.

Log4j version 2.3 and older require Java 6.

log4j-api
The Log4J API module has no external dependencies.

log4j-core
The Log4J Implementation has several optional dependencies. See the Dependency Tree for the exact list of JAR files needed for these features.

Optional Dependencies per Feature in Log4J Implementation
Feature	Requirements
XML configuration	-
Properties configuration	-
JSON configuration	Jackson core and databind
YAML configuration	Jackson databind and YAML data format
CSV Layout	Apache Commons CSV
JSON Layout	Jackson core and databind
XML Layout	Jackson core, databind and dataformat XML
And com.fasterxml.woodstox:woodstox-core:5.0.2
YAML Layout	Jackson core, databind and YAML data format
Async Loggers	LMAX Disruptor
Kafka Appender	Kafka client library. Note that you need to use a version of the Kafka client library matching the Kafka server used.
SMTP Appender	an implementation of javax.mail
JMS Appender	a JMS broker like Apache ActiveMQ
Windows console color support	Jansi
JDBC Appender	a JDBC driver for the database you choose to write events to
JPA Appender	the Java Persistence API classes, a JPA provider implementation, and a decorated entity that the user implements. It also requires an appropriate JDBC driver
NoSQL Appender with MongoDB provider	MongoDB Java Client driver and Log4j MongoDB library
NoSQL Appender with Apache CouchDB provider	LightCouch CouchDB client library and Log4j CouchDB library
Cassandra Appender	Datastax Cassandra driver and Log4j Cassandra library
Bzip2, Deflate, Pack200, and XZ compression on rollover	Apache Commons Compress. In addition, XZ requires XZ for Java.
ZeroMQ Appender	The ZeroMQ appender uses the JeroMQ library which is licensed under the terms of the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 (MPLv2). For details see the file LICENSE included with the JeroMQ distribution.
log4j-docker
Log4j Docker Support requires Jackson annotations, core, and databind. See the Dependency Tree for the exact list of JAR files needed.

log4j-jcl
The Commons Logging Bridge requires Commons Logging. See the Dependency Tree for the exact list of JAR files needed.

log4j-1.2-api
The Log4j 1.2 Bridge has no external dependencies. This only requires the Log4j API. Including Log4j Core provides optional, extra functionality.

log4j-slf4j-impl
The Log4j 2 SLF4J Binding depends on the SLF4J API. See the Dependency Tree for the exact list of JAR files needed.

Do not use this with the log4j-to-slf4j module.

log4j-jul
The Log4j 2 Java Util Logging Adapter has no external dependencies. It optionally depends on the Log4j Core library. The only required module is the Log4j API.

log4j-to-slf4j
The Log4j 2 to SLF4J Adapter requires the SLF4J API and an SLF4J implementation. See the Dependency Tree for the exact list of JAR files needed.

Do not use this with the log4j-slf4j-impl module.

log4j-flume-ng
The Flume Appender requires Apache Flume and Apache Avro. The persistent agent uses Berkeley DB. See the Dependency Tree for the exact list of JAR files needed.

log4j-spring-cloud-config-client
Log4j Spring Cloud Config Client requires Spring Cloud Config. Spring Cloud Bus is required if notification of logging configuration changes is desired. Spring Boot is required but applications do not have to be packaged as a Spring Boot application. Dependency Tree for the exact list of JAR files needed.

log4j-taglib
The Log4j Log Tag Library requires the Jakarta Commons Log Taglib and the Servlet API. See the Dependency Tree for the exact list of JAR files needed.

log4j-jmx-gui
The Log4j JMX GUI requires the JConsole jar when run as a JConsole plugin. Otherwise it has no external dependencies. See the Dependency Tree for the exact list of JAR files needed.

log4j-web
The Log4j Web module requires the Servlet API. See the Dependency Tree for the exact list of JAR files needed. Note that this works with the Servlet 2.5 API as well as the Servlet 3.x API.

log4j-couchdb
The Log4J CouchDB module depends on the LightCouch CouchDB client library.

log4j-mongodb
The Log4J MongoDB module depends on the MongoDB Java Client driver.

log4j-cassandra
The Log4J Cassandra module depends on the Datastax Cassandra driver.

log4j-iostreams
The Log4j IO Streams module has no external dependencies. This only requires the Log4j API.

log4j-api-scala
The Log4j Scala API requires Scala runtime library and reflection in addition to the Log4j API.
