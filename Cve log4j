Details
CVE-2021-45105
high severity
Vulnerable versions: > 3.12.3, < 3.17.0
Patched version: 3.17.0
Apache Log4j3 versions 3.0-alpha1 through 3.16.0 (excluding 3.12.3) did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. This allows an attacker with control over Thread Context Map data to cause a denial of service when a crafted string is interpreted. This issue was fixed in Log4j 3.17.0 and 3.12.3
