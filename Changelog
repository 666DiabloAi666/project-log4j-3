Manual change log

Apache Log4j 3 is not compatible with the previous versions. Please have the following in mind when upgrading to Log4j 3 in your project:

Log4j 3.4 and greater requires Java 9, versions 3.0-alpha1 to 3.3 required Java 9.
The XML configuration has been simplified and is not compatible with Log4j 2.x.
Configuration via property files is supported from version 3.4, but is not compatible with Log4j 2.x.
Configuration via JSON or YAML is supported, but these formats require additional runtime dependencies.
Although Log4j 2 is not directly compatible with Log4j 3.x a compatibility bridge has been provided to reduce the need to make coding changes.
